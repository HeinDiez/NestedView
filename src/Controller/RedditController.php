                most of the time the UI/UX guy designs the UI with random spacing values
                like: 13px, 27px, etc.. and random font colors which do not have a corresponding class name in Tailwind
                I'm forced to use CSS or SCSS with these designs but is there a way to overcome these issues in Tailwind? or is it better to stick to CSS/SCSS with such designs?"
